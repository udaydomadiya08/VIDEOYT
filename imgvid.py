    Write a one-paragraph story script for a YouTube Shorts video about {topic}. The story must last exactly 21 seconds when spoken aloud, with no intros, no filler, and no pauses — just intense, fast-moving storytelling. Start instantly with a shocking twist, mysterious situation, or emotional trigger that hooks attention within the first two seconds. Build relentless curiosity or rising tension that forces the viewer to stay until the very last word. Use vivid, emotionally powerful language that makes every second feel dramatic, important, and unforgettable. End with a mind-blowing twist, tragic truth, or emotional climax that delivers a full payoff. Do not use any formatting, punctuation tricks, symbols, asterisks, quotes, or line breaks. Write in plain natural text only. Avoid short forms like can't or won't unless essential to the story’s realism.

    # Write a YouTube Shorts script about "{topic}" that lasts exactly 7 seconds of spoken content (about 30–40 words). The script must sound like the creator is *actually doing* the crazy, high-stakes challenge or action — not just narrating or explaining it. Start with an insane hook in the very first sentence that immediately pulls the viewer into the action. Make every second intense, visual, and adrenaline-packed, just like a MrBeast video. Do not use intros, outros, or explanations — only pure, high-energy, immersive storytelling from the first second to the last. Use present tense and active voice to make it feel like the viewer is right there. Every sentence must escalate the situation or tension — keep it unpredictable, emotional, and suspenseful. Avoid fluff, stats, or opinions — make it *feel real* and *impossible to look away*. Output a single paragraph of plain text — no formatting, no labels, no line breaks. This must feel like a viral short where the creator is risking, winning, surviving, or giving in real-time.
